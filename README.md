## About Olist Store Case Study
Olist is an e-commerce site of Brazil which provides a better platform to connect merchants and their product to the main marketplace of Brazil.
It provides good services for the merchants to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist 
logistics partners.Its business is based on interaction between consumer ,olist store and the seller.At first an order is made by the consumer on 
the olist site. This order is received by olist store ,based on the information of the order (like product category,geolocation,mode of payment e.t.c) 
a notification is forwarded to the sellers. After that product is received from the seller and delivered to the consumer within the estimated delivery
time. Once the customer receives the product,or if the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he/she can give 
a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments. 

The data-set has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allow viewing an order from multiple 
dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. 
A Geo-location data-set that relates Brazilian zip codes to lat/long coordinates has also been released.

The objective of Olist this year is to grow total sales revenue (Olist has no control over the prices and shipping charges set by its partners).

## 2. Opportunity 1: More Customers (New Customers + Retain Customers)

**Insights:**

From January 2017 to December 2017, the number of new customers grew steadily, with a sharp spike in November 2017 (possibly due to Black Friday).

From January 2018 to August 2018, the number of new customers slightly decreased but remained stable at around 6,000 to 7,000 customers.

**Recommendation:**

Olist needs to implement additional marketing strategies to attract more new customers in order to achieve a 10% revenue growth in the next year.

**Analyze top cities with the highest performance and top best-selling products**

Sao Paulo is the city with the highest concentration of Olist customers. The product lines that are most in demand in this area are bed bath tables and health beauty products.

Since Sao Paulo is the area with the highest concentration of customers and strong demand for bed bath tables, it is important to leverage the current momentum by developing a marketing/promotion strategy targeting Sao Paulo with bath table and health beauty products to attract more new customers.
